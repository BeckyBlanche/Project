<h2>Is it really the IRS calling?</h2>
<blockquote> Understand how and when the IRS contacts taxpayers and determine if it’s truly <br>the IRS.
Private Debt Collection
Even with private debt collection, <br>you shouldn’t receive unexpected calls. IRS mails several notices before calling.<br>
View your account balance
Check your account balance. If nothing is due,<br> you typically wouldn’t be contacted by IRS or a private firm.</blockquote> <br><br>
<h2>Is the IRS Really the BAD Guys?</h2>
<blockquote>  The IRS is the policing agency for Congress.  Congress, the people we elect,<br>  make the laws that the IRS enforces.   Just like the police enforce public law.  Of course, <br>there are bad cops, and there are bad IRS agents, but most of the agents I have known <br>or dealt with have been genuinely considerate and helpful.</blockquote>
